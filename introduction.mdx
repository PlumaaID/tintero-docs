---

Tintero is a set of smart contracts that allow lending ERC-20 in exchange for tokenized Real World Assets (RWA) generated by [Plumaa ID](https://docs.plumaa.id). The protocol establishes rules through which investors can provide liquidity for traditional assets (such as real state, IOUs, etc.) represented through an ERC-721 token.
