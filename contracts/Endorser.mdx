**Author:**

A contract to track digital endorsements according to Mexican comercial and debt instruments law. This contract
allows for any user to mint a new token by providing the hash of the digital document a provenance proof checked against
the [Witness](https://docs.witness.co/api-reference/solidity/Witness.sol) and a valid signature from an authorizer.
Privacy is ensured by only tracking the hash of the document, and not the document itself.

<Note>
Property is tied to regular Ethereum addresses. It's the responsibility of the developer to implement a robust
regulatory framework to ensure the link between the owner and such address.

## State Variables
### ENDORSER_STORAGE

```solidity
bytes32 private constant ENDORSER_STORAGE = 0xd4afa66895d5fdd6c8f53a8b47d14ebe8786dd18400174140b53bbb9a8838e00;
```


### PROVENANCE_AUTHORIZER_ROLE

```solidity
uint64 internal constant PROVENANCE_AUTHORIZER_ROLE = uint64(bytes8(keccak256("PlumaaID.PROVENANCE_AUTHORIZER")));
```


### _MINT_AUTHORIZATION_TYPEHASH

```solidity
bytes32 internal constant _MINT_AUTHORIZATION_TYPEHASH = keccak256("MintRequest(bytes32 leaf,address to)");
```


## Functions
### constructor

**Note:**
oz-upgrades-unsafe-allow: constructor


```solidity
constructor();
```

### getProvenanceHash

Leaf hash. Uses SHA256 according to the algorithms approved by the Mexican government.


```solidity
function getProvenanceHash(bytes memory data) public pure virtual override returns (bytes32);
```

### initialize

Initializes the contract setting an initial authority and a Witness contract


```solidity
function initialize(address initialAuthority, IWitness witness) public initializer;
```

### WITNESS

The Witness contract that this contract uses to verify provenance.


```solidity
function WITNESS() public view virtual override returns (IWitness);
```

### mint

Mints a new token for the provided `to` address if the proof is valid and nullifies it so it can't be used again.


```solidity
function mint(MintRequestData calldata request, Proof calldata proof) external;
```

### setWitness

Sets the Witness contract

<Note>
Witness is set by default to the mainnet address, it should be updated
to the correct address before deployment when deploying to testnets.
</Note>


```solidity
function setWitness(IWitness witness) external restricted;
```

### _baseURI


```solidity
function _baseURI() internal pure override returns (string memory);
```

### _validateAndNullifyProof

Checks whether a proof is valid and nullifies it so it can't be used again.

Requirements:

- The leaf was not nullified before.
- The mint request was signed by an authorizer.
- The authorizer is a member of the PROVENANCE_AUTHORIZER_ROLE.
- The proof is valid according to the Witness contract.


```solidity
function _validateAndNullifyProof(MintRequestData calldata request, Proof calldata proof) internal;
```

### _getEndorserStorage

Get EIP-7201 storage


```solidity
function _getEndorserStorage() private pure returns (EndorserStorage storage $);
```

### _authorizeUpgrade


```solidity
function _authorizeUpgrade(address newImplementation) internal override restricted;
```

## Errors
### AlreadyClaimed

```solidity
error AlreadyClaimed();
```

### InvalidAuthorization

```solidity
error InvalidAuthorization();
```

## Structs
### MintRequestData

```solidity
struct MintRequestData {
    address authorizer;
    address to;
    bytes signature;
}
```

### EndorserStorage

```solidity
struct EndorserStorage {
    BitMaps.BitMap _nullifier;
    IWitness _witness;
}
```
