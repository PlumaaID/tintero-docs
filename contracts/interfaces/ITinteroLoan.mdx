Interface for a loan contract that uses an ERC721 token as collateral.
The loan is funded with an ERC20 token and structured in a series of payments and
tranches.

## Functions
### lendingAsset

```solidity
function lendingAsset() external view returns (IERC20);
```

function collateralAsset() external view returns (ERC721Burnable);
```

### liquidityProvider

A tranche is a collection of payments from [paymentIndex ?? 0, nextPaymentIndex)*

```solidity
function totalTranches() external view returns (uint256);

### pushPayments

*Adds a list of payments to the loan.

Requirements:

- The owner of each collateral tokenId MUST have approved this contract
to transfer it (if not the contract itself).

Effects:

- The `totalPayments` is incremented by the length of the payments array.
- The `collateralTokenIds` are transferred to this contract.
- The `payment` function will return the added payments at their corresponding
indexes starting at `totalPayments`.
- Emits a `PaymentCreated` event for each payment added.*

function pushPayments(uint256[] calldata collateralTokenIds, PaymentLib.Payment[] calldata payments)
    external
    returns (uint256 principalRequested);
```

### pushTranches

*Adds a list of tranches to the loan.

Requirements:

- The caller MUST be the liquidity provider.
- The loan MUST be in CREATED state.
- The tranchePaymentIndexes and trancheRecipients arrays MUST have the same length.
- The tranche indexes MUST be strictly increasing.
- The total number of tranches MUST be less than the total number of payments.

Effects:

- The `totalTranches` is incremented by the length of the tranches array.
- The `tranche` function will return the added tranches at their corresponding
indexes starting at `totalTranches`.
- The tranches are added to the loan.
- Emits a `TrancheCreated` event for each tranche added.*


```solidity
function pushTranches(uint96[] calldata paymentIndexes, address[] calldata recipients) external;
```

### fundN

Requirements:

- The loan MUST be in CREATED or FUNDING state.
- Tranches MUST include all payments.
- The caller MUST have enough funds to fund the payments
- This contract mus have been approved to transfer the principal
amount from the caller.

Effects:

- Moves to FUNDING state
- Moves to ONGOING state if all payments are funded.
- The `currentFundingIndex` is incremented by `n` or the remaining payments.
- The principal of the funded payments is transferred from the liquidity provider to the beneficiary.
- Sets the `fundedAt` field of the funded payments to the current block timestamp.
- Emits a `PaymentsFunded` event with the range of funded payments.*


```solidity
function fundN(uint256 n) external returns (uint256 principalFunded);
```

### withdrawPaymentCollateral

*Withdraws the collateral to the beneficiary.

Requirements:

- The loan MUST be in CREATED or CANCELED state.
- Each payment collateral MUST be owned by this contract.
- The caller MUST be the beneficiary.

Effects:

- Moves to CANCELED state.
- Each payment collateral is transferred to the beneficiary.
- Emits a `PaymentsWithdrawn` with the range of payments withdrawn*


```solidity
function withdrawPaymentCollateral(uint256 start, uint256 end) external;
```

### repayCurrent

*Same as `repayN(0, collateralReceiver)`.*


```solidity
function repayCurrent(address collateralReceiver) external;

### repayN

*Repays the current loan and `n` future payments.

Requirements:

- The loan MUST be in ONGOING or DEFAULTED state.
- The sender MUST have enough funds to repay the principal of the specified payments
- The sender MUST have approved this contract to transfer the principal amount
- The collateral MUST be owned by this contract.

Effects:

- Moves to ONGOING if paid until below the default threshold.
- Moves to PAID state if all payments are repaid.
- The `currentPaymentIndex` is incremented by `n` or the remaining payments.
- The principal of the repaid payments is transferred from the sender to the receiver of each payment tranche
- The collateral is transferred to the collateralReceiver if provided, otherwise it is burned.
- Emits a `PaymentsRepaid` event with the range of repaid payments.*


```solidity
function repayN(uint256 n, address collateralReceiver) external;
```

### repossess

*Repossess the collateral from payments.

Requirements:

- The loan MUST be in DEFAULTED or REPOSSESSED state.

### OnlyLiquidityProvider
*Only the liquidity provider can perform the operation.*

error InvalidBeneficiary();

### OnlyBeneficiary
*Only the beneficiary can perform the operation.*

error OnlyBeneficiary();
```

### MismatchedPaymentCollateralIds
*The payments array doesn't match the collateral tokenIds array.*

```solidity
error MismatchedTranchePaymentIndexRecipient();
