**Inherits:**
[IERC4626](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/5.x/api/interfaces#IERC4626)

*Interface for an ERC4626 that manages ITinteroLoan contracts.
The vault's assets are either lent to Loan contracts or delegated to other addresses
to maximize the utilization of the assets.*


## Functions
### totalAssetsDelegated

*The total amount of idle assets delegated.*


```solidity
function totalAssetsDelegated() external view returns (uint256);
```

### delegatedTo

*The total amount of idle assets delegated to an address.*


```solidity
function delegatedTo(address delegate) external view returns (uint256);
```

### totalAssetsLent

*The total amount of assets lent to Loan contracts.*


```solidity
function totalAssetsLent() external view returns (uint256);
```

### lentTo

*The total amount of assets lent to a Loan contract.*


```solidity
function lentTo(address loan) external view returns (uint256);
```

### isLoan

*Whether a Loan contract is managed by this vault.*


```solidity
function isLoan(address loan) external view returns (bool);
```

### askDelegation

*Delegates assets to an address.*


```solidity
function askDelegation(uint256 amount) external;
```

### refundDelegation

*Refunds delegated assets from an address.*


```solidity
function refundDelegation(uint256 amount) external;
```

### forceRefundDelegation


```solidity
function forceRefundDelegation(address delegate, uint256 amount) external;
```

### requestLoan

*Creates a new instance of a Loan contract with the provided parameters.*


```solidity
function requestLoan(
    address collateralCollection,
    address beneficiary,
    uint24 defaultThreshold,
    PaymentLib.Payment[] calldata payments,
    uint256[] calldata collateralTokenIds,
    bytes32 salt
) external;
```

### pushPayments

*Adds a list of payments to a Loan contract. Calls Loan#pushPayments.*


```solidity
function pushPayments(ITinteroLoan loan, uint256[] calldata collateralTokenIds, PaymentLib.Payment[] calldata payments)
    external;
```

### onDebit

*Debits an outstanding principal from a Loan contract.*


```solidity
function onDebit(uint256 principal) external;
```

### pushTranches

*Adds a list of tranches to a Loan contract. Calls Loan#pushTranches.*


```solidity
function pushTranches(ITinteroLoan loan, uint96[] calldata paymentIndexes, address[] calldata recipients) external;
```

### fundN

*Funds `n` payments from a Loan contract. Calls Loan#fundN.*


```solidity
function fundN(ITinteroLoan loan, uint256 n) external;
```

### repossess

*Repossess a range of payments from a Loan contract. Calls Loan#repossess.*


```solidity
function repossess(ITinteroLoan loan, uint256 start, uint256 end, address receiver) external;
```

### upgradeLoan

*Upgrades a Loan contract to a new implementation. Calls Loan#upgradeLoan.*


```solidity
function upgradeLoan(ITinteroLoan loan, address newImplementation, bytes calldata data) external;
```

## Events
### LoanCreated
*Emitted when a Loan contract is created by this vault.*


```solidity
event LoanCreated(address loan, address collateralCollection, address beneficiary, uint24 defaultThreshold);
```

### DelegateAssets
*Emitted when assets are delegated to an address.*


```solidity
event DelegateAssets(address delegate, uint256 amount);
```

### DelegateRefunded
*Emitted when assets are refunded from an address.*


```solidity
event DelegateRefunded(address delegate, uint256 amount);
```

## Errors
### DuplicatedLoan
*Reverts if a Loan contract is already created by this vault.*


```solidity
error DuplicatedLoan();
```

### OnlyManagedLoan
*Reverts if the caller is not a Loan contract created by this vault.*


```solidity
error OnlyManagedLoan();
```
