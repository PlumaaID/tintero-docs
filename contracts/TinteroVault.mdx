description: An ERC-4626 vault that allocates assets towards funding loans

**Author:**
Ernesto Garc√≠a

An [ERC4626](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/5.x/erc4626) vault that receives
an ERC20 token in exchange for shares and allocates these assets towards funding Loan contracts
collateralized by tokenized ERC721 obligations. Idle capital is delegated to other addresses to
maximize the yield of the vault's assets.

The contract keeps track of the total assets in management by suming the total assets lent to
Loan contracts and the total assets held by the vault, allowing owners to withdraw their assets
at any time unless the vault does not have enough assets to cover the withdrawal (i.e. everything is
lent out or delegated).

## Concepts

- **Shares**: The vault's shares represent the ownership of the vault's assets. They can be
redeemed for the underlying assets if the vault has enough liquidity. They appreciate in value
as the vault's assets grow when Loan contracts are paid back.
- **Assets**: The vault's assets are the ERC20 tokens lent to Loan contracts. They are used to
fund Loan contracts and are returned to the vault plus interests when the Loan contracts are
paid back.
- **Loans**: Loan contracts are created by the vault and have a list of ERC721-backed payments.
- **Tranches**: A tranche is a collection of Loan payments from whose payments are sent to a tranche
recipient.
- **Payments**: A payment has a principal amount in ERC20 tokens that is due at the end of the maturity
period and defaults after the grace period. Each one is backed by an ERC721 token.

## Requesting a Loan
Any user can permissionlessly request a Loan by calling `requestLoan`. The Loan contract is created
by the vault and the Loan contract address is added to the vault's list of authorized Loans. Must
be funded by the vault by calling `fundN`.

## Vault Management
The vault is managed by an access manager instance that controls the permissions of critical
vault's functions. These functions include:

- `askDelegation`: Takes assets from the vault to use them in other protocols to maximize the
yield of the vault's assets.
- `pushTranches`: Adds a list of tranches to a Loan contract.
- `fundN`: Funds `n` payments from a Loan contract.
- `repossess`: Repossess a range of payments from a Loan contract and cancels it. The Vault will
receive the ERC721 tokens and will cancel the tracked assets lent (absorbing the loss).
- `upgradeLoan`: Upgrades a Loan contract to a new implementation. Allows renegotiating the terms
of the Loan contract.
## KYC and Accredited Investors
The `mint` and `deposit` functions are restricted to accredited investors that require a KYC check
before providing liqudity. However, the `withdraw` and `redeem` functions are permissionless, so
investors can withdraw their assets at any time as long as the vault has enough liquidity.
