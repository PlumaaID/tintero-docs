Loan that uses an ERC721 token as collateral. The loan is funded with
an ERC20 token and structured in a series of payments and tranches they belong to.
This contract behaves as a state machine with the following states:
- CREATED: The loan has been initialized and payments or tranches are being added.
- CANCELED: The loan has been canceled and the collateral is being withdrawn.
- FUNDING: The loan is being funded by the liquidity provider.
- ONGOING: The loan has been funded and the payments are being repaid.
- DEFAULTED: The loan has defaulted and the collateral can be repossessed.
- REPOSSESSED: The collateral is being repossessed by the liquidity provider.
- PAID: The loan has been fully repaid.

### Concepts

- Payments: A payment is a structure that represents a payment to be made back to the loan.
Each payment has a principal amount and an interest rate that is accrued over time in a
linear fashion. A premium rate is added to the interest rate after the payment is due (at maturity).
- Tranches: A tranche is a collection of payments that have the same recipient. They are used
to sell parts of the loan to different investors.
- Collateral: The collateral is an ERC721 token that is used to back the payments. A payment's
collateral can be repossessed if the loan defaults after a default threshold.

<Note>
Users must approve this contract to transfer their ERC-721 tokens used as collateral.
This may allow a malicious actor to transfer request a loan and transferring their tokens
to this contract unexpectedly. For those cases, the original owner can retake their collateral
with the `withdrawPaymentCollateral` function.
