Tintero is an asset-backed security (ABS) lending protocol that provides liquidity in exchange for tokenized receivables (or any negotiable instrument). These negotiable instruments are represented as NFTs whose identifier is the hash of a document representing the underlying asset.

Investors can deposit their assets in a Tintero vault (e.g USDC) and receive shares in exchange. These shares are later allocated towards funding loans approved by a vault manager.

On the other side, asset originators can write loans, leases, or any other kind of Real World Asset (RWA) and tokenize them using [Plumaa ID](https://plumaa.id). These tokens are used as collateral to request a loan from a Tintero vault. If the manager approves the loan, the loan is funded and the principal is transferred to a beneficiary address.

Assets are represented through the Endorser contract, an ERC721 token that uses a document hash as a token id. It complies with data preservation requirements and a non-interrupted chain of endorsements under Mexican commercial and debt instruments law by indexing the chain of transfers (i.e. endorsements) whose signatures are non-repudiably linked to the user's address when transferring via Plumaa ID.

The content of documents remains private since the system only track hashes.
