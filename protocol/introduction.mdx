description: How Tintero works under the hood
---

Tintero is a set of smart contracts to which we refer to as _the protocol_. The protocol is composed by 4 smart contracts from which 2 are core to each Tintero pool and the other 2 can be considered accessories:

### Pool contracts

<CardGroup cols={1}>
  <Card
    title="TinteroVault"
    icon="vault"
    href="/protocol/vault"
  >
   An ERC-4626 vault with extra features to manage capital delegations and loan funding. It deploys instances of the TinteroLoan contract and is managed by the AccessManager contract.  
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Protocol"
    icon="landmark"
    href="/protocol/loan"
  >
    A state machine that manages the lifecycle of a loan structured as a series of payments, each one collateralized by an ERC-721 token that represents a discounted legally-binding obligations.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Accessory contracts

- **AccessManager**: A contract that manages roles and permissions for all contracts in the Tintero protocol.
- **Endorser**: An ERC-721 contract provided by [Plumaa ID](https://docs.plumaa.id) that represents a legally-binding obligation. Any other ERC-721 contract can be used as a collateral for each loan, independently of which vault it belongs to.
